# Image resolution changer
This is a console application using .Net Core 2.0 and ImageMagick to change the resolution of images and strip them from METADATA.
As it was originally only for personal use, most of the code is aesthetic.

## Build process and Usage
It is neccessary to have .Net Core installed (2.0 or above) to restore and build the project.
The console application takes the image path as a parameter and upon running asks for the output resolution.
